# Your own star

Space is so big, the universe so big,
and therefore you can own a little bit.

For now on you will have stars.

## My star, your star

### Create the universe and login

As usual, create the universe and login.

 Click _New_ in the main header.
 Type _TwoStars_ into the _map code_.
 Click the _Create_ button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT newUniverse status=200 -->
 Click _Play_ in the main header.
 Type your username.
 Click the _Log in_ button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT loginYours status=200 -->
 Now you see the _map of the game_.
 
### And now comes the magic

Something has changed. 
Like before
 there is a _star_ at coordinates _3,3_ and
 there is a _star_ at coordinates _3,4_.
But now you can see that 
 there is something of yours at coordinates _3,3_.

### Share the space

Yes, you have your own star, but others deserve
their own stars.

 Click _Game_ in the main header.
 Click the _Logout_ button.
 Click _Play_ in the main header.
 Type _garak_ into the _username_.

Like before, 
 now you see the _map of the game_,
 there is a _star_ at coordinates _3,3_ and
 there is a _star_ at coordinates _3,4_.
But this time, you see that
 there is something of garak at coordinates _3,4_.
