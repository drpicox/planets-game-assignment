# Let there be light

Welcome to the Planets Game.
Today is a very special day, 
today we launch the first version of the game.

It is not great think, 
but it has blo at least the minimum necessary to have: 
- Â¡a universe full of stars!

## Create the universe

### Create the universe

In the beginning there was nothing, which exploded.
Then you enter to the game, and created a new universe:

 Click _New_ in the main header.
 Type _TwoStars_ into the _map code_.
 Click the _Create_ button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT newUniverse status=200 -->
 
### Enter in the universe

Now you can login and see the universe.

 Click _Play_ in the main header.
 Type your username.
 Click the _Log in_ button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT loginGame status=200 -->
 
### See the map

 Now you see the _map of the game_.
 There is a _star_ at coordinates _3,3_.
 There is a _star_ at coordinates _3,4_.

## Ops! Wrong Map

You are powerful but not almighty.
If you enter the wrong map code, no universe will be created.

 Click _New_ in the main header.
 Type _WrongUniverse_ into the _map code_.
 Click the _Create_ button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT wrongUniverse status=400 -->
 Wait for an alert saying _wrong map code_.
