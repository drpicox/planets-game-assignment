# Stars and population

Stars were so alone,
and population appeared.

Now you can have your own population.
Be special, live on a star system.

## My population, your population

As usual, create the universe and login.

 Click _New_ in the main header.
 Type _TwoStars_ into the _map code_.
 Click the _Create_ button. 
 <!-- SNAPSHOT newUniverse status=200 -->
 Click _Play_ in the main header.
 Type your username.
 Click the _Log in_ button. 
 <!-- SNAPSHOT loginGame status=200 -->
 Now you see the _map of the game_, and
 there is a _star_ at coordinates _3,3_ and 
 there is a _star_ at coordinates _3,4_.
 
### Your Star
 
Let's see with more detail that star,
 click at coordinates _3,3_.
 You see the _star_ _Bajor_,
 it has a _population_ of _100_.
 
### Garak's Star

And what happens with Garak's star?

 Click the _Back_ button to return to the map.
 Click at coordinates _3,4_.
 You see the _star_ _Cardassia_, and now you will see that 
 it has no _population_.

That is right, you cannot see the population 
of a star of other player.
