 Now you see the _map of the game_, and
 there is a _star_ at coordinates _3,3_.
 
### Ask you star for a ship
 
 Click at coordinates _3,3_,
 You see the _star_ _Bajor_.
 Type _Defiant_ into its _new ship name_.
 
You have asked for it, but that is not
enough. You have to give time
to build the new ship. 
Â¿How much time? One turn.

### Save your game

Let's speedup things.

 Click the _Log in_ button. 
 <!-- SNAPSHOT recoverSaved status=200 -->

 There is a _star_ at coordinates _3,3_.
 Click at coordinates _3,3_.
 You see the _star_ _Bajor_, and if
 it has _Defiant_ typed into the _new ship name_,
then everything is ok.

### Compile the turn

Make pass the time, compile your turn.

 Click _Game_ in the main header.
 Click the _Compile game_ button.
